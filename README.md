# Final Project for ProgrammingLanguages class
In an attempt to showcase the most promiment features of Dart programming language ([dartlang.org](http://dartlang.org)), we decided to build a web application that would store information about FIFA games that take place in my dorm room, Hill 119. 

BTW, big shout-out to [Michael Chang'13](http://https://src-code.simons-rock.edu/git/mchang13) for his help with making this project happen.

## Where can I take a look at it?

Currently the web app is not hosted anywhere (besides locally on my PC). As soon as time permits, we are planning on hosting it for public use on the src-code server.

Meanwhile, to get the app running locally, please follow the [guide for setting up Dart locally](http://https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular/guide/setup).

After that is done, clone this repo and run
```
$ pub get
```
followed by
```
$ pub serve
```
The app should be available via your browser by typing *http://localhost:8080*
